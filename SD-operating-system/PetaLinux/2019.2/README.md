PetaLinux build guide
=====================

This guide is created to walk you through the installation process of the operating system PetaLinux, in order to boot it from a SD card. The procedure followed in this guide considers the use of a ZedBoard, which we want to be able to use with the Xilinx software.

The guide is divided in two main parts, which includes the installation of the Vivado SDK and the cofiguring of the PetaLinux project for ZedBoard. It is important to note that the versions for both PetaLinux and Vivado should be the same. We will be working with version 2019.2 in this guide.

Vivado SDK
----------
First of all, it is neccesary to install the Vivado SDK. The software can be dowloaded from the Xilinx webpage, where it's neccesary to create an account in order to download any packages. To install both the Vivado and Vitis IDE, [click here](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html).
